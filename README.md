# ML-Algos-UCI-Dataset
The repository contains Jupyter Notebook for implementation of some machine Learning Algorithms on UCI dataset implemented as a part of the course CSE 4020

## List of Experiments to be implemented

- [x] 1. Implement decision tree algorithm and test the algorithm using any data set of your choice from UCI repository. The output should include Accuracy, Error rate, Precision and recall rate along with the confusion matrix.

- [x] 2. Implement logistic regression algorithm and test the algorithm using any data set of your choice from UCI repository. The output should include Accuracy, Error rate, Precision and recall rate along with the confusion matrix.

- [ ] 3. Implement Multilayer perceptron and analyze the classification result for any one  of the dataset of your choice.

- [ ] 4. Implement Adaboost algorithm to boost the performance of decision trees on binary classification problems.

- [ ] 5. Implement Support Vector Machine Algorithm for Multi-class classification with the choice of having different kernels.

- [ ] 6. Implement partitioned clustering. 1. K means clustering 2. K mode clustering and check your code using the following performance metric 1. Accuracy 2. Error rate 3. F1 Measure and 4. Adjusted rand index. 

- [ ] 7. Implement Hierarchical clustering and check the results using Accuracy, Error rate, F1 Measure and  Adjusted rand index.
